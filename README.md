# LC-Waikiki-Project
Interactive transfer of the products of LC WAIKIKI company from 2d environment to 3d environment.
In the project we developed for the LC Waikiki company, we transitioned the company's products from a 2D environment to a 3D environment. 
The 3D designs of the products were made with Blender. 
This project is a demo. The main project includes a more detailed UI panel, more products, and a higher quality 3D environment.
